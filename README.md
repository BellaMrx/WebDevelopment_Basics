   ###  Basic knowledge
   - HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is a markup language that allows defining the structure and semantics of web pages using elements.
   - HTML elements have an opening and a closing tag
   - Attributes can be used to pass additional information to an opening tag.
   - Attributes consist of a name and an associated value.
   - There are HTML elements that can contain other elements (child elements) and text, as well as empty elements that must not contain text or other elements.
   - Web pages or HTML documents are simply text documents.
   - There are many different HTML elements. Among the most important are headings, text paragraphs, lists, links, images, tables, and forms.

   ###  Basic knowledge
   - CSS rules let you define how the content of certain HTML elements should be displayed.
   - CSS rules consist of two parts: The selector defines which HTML elements the CSS rule should be applied to. The declaration defines how exactly these HTML elements are to be displayed.
   - Individual declarations in turn consist of a property and a value. 
   - There are several ways to include CSS in an HTML document: External Stylesheet, Internal Stylesheet, Inline Styles.
   - CSS can be used to design all components of a web page. For texts, for example, the font, font style, text color and alignment can be adjusted. It can also be used to design tables, lists, forms and much more. 
   - In CSS there are several layout systems for arranging elements: Float layout, Flexbox layout, Grid layout.

   ###  Basic knowledge
   - JavaScript can be included in a web page in several ways. However, you should get into the habit of managing JavaScript code in separate files.
   - Variables can be defined in JavaScript using the let keyword, while constants can be defined using the const keyword.
   - There are different data types in JavaScript: on the one hand, the standard primitive data types for numbers, strings, and Boolean values, as well as the special data types undefined and null, and on the other hand, objects.
   - In JavaScript there are different types of operations available: arithmetic operators, operators for working with strings, logical operations for working with boolean values, bitwise operators for working with bits, operators for comparing values, special operators for type checking, among others.
   - You can control the control flow of a JavaScript_program using conditional statements, branching, multiple branching, counting loops, and header-controlled and footer-controlled loops.
   - You can define reusable program parts via functions. Functions can be called with arguments and return a return value.
   - In JavaScript there are different types of errors: syntx errors, runtime errors, logical errors. 
   - When an error occurs during the execution of a program, you can react to such errors: Using the keyword try you mark the statements that could potentially throw errors, using the keyword catch you define the statements that should be executed in case of an error.
   - With JavaScript you have the possibility to generate HTML code dynamically.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ## 4 - Weblogs


 ![Preview](Images/Statuscodes.png)


   ###  Basic knowledge
   - HTTP, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol is a unidirectional client/server protocol where the HTTP client makes HTTP requests to the HTTP server and the server responds with an HTTP response.
   - Using headers, it can pass additional meta-information to HTTP requests and HTTP responses.
   - HTTP methods define what actions should be performed on the HTTP server.
   - The status code of an HTTP response defines whether an HTTP request was successfully processed or not. 
   - MIME types define the format of the data that is transferred via an HTTP request or an HTTP response.
   - Polling and long polling are techniques by which a cleint polls data from the server at regular intervals. The communication is unidirectional from the client to the server.
   - Server-sent events allow data to be actively sent from the server to the client. The communication is unidirectional from the server to the client.
   - The WebSocket client can send data to the WebSocket server, but also the server can actively send data to the client - provided that the client has previously established a Web socket connection to the server. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ![Preview](Images/ImageFormats.PNG)

 ![Preview](Images/AudioVideoAttributes.png)


   ### Basic knowledge
   - CSV format is a very simple data format, suitable for defining records line by line and separated by commas.
   - For the structuring of complex data, for example nested data, the XML and JSON data formats are suitable.
   - XML and JSON are the two most important data exchange formats on the web.
   - JSON has become somewhat more popular over XML in recent years because it is much leaner and much easier to process in JavaScript.
   - For saving images and graphics you can use different formats: JPG, GIF, PNG, SVG, WebP.
   - For embedding video and audio files, since HTML5 you can use the video and audio elements.
   - There are many different video and audio formats, but thanks to the HTML elements you can include several formats for one video or for one audio file.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ## 6 - Web APIs
  * #### Part_1 - Select elements
    - selection of all elements with the CSS class "even" and subsequent iteration over the elements
  * #### Part_2 - Change elements
    - create and add a text node
  * #### Part_3 - Dynamically create a table

  ### JavaScript - HTML DOM Methods
   #### the different methods and properties for selecting elements


 ![Preview](Images/DOM_1.PNG)


   #### the different methods and properties for modifying elements


 ![Preview](Images/DOM_2.PNG)


   ### Basic knowledge
   - The DOM API allows programmatic access to the Document Object Model(DOM), a hierarchical tree structure that represents the object model for a web page.
   - The individual components in this tree structure are called nodes, and there are several types of nodes. The most important are document nodes, element nodes, text nodes, and attribute nodes.
   - The DOM API defines properties and methods that you can use to access or modify the DOM tree of a web page.
   - For example, you can use the DOM API to add elements, delete elements, modify text, and add or delete attributes .
   - Elements on a web page can be selected in various ways by: ID, CSS class, element name, name attribute, CSS selector.
   - Starting from an element/node, the parent element/node, child elements/child nodes and sibling elements/sibling nodes can be selected via various properties.
   - Via the property textContent they can access the text content of a node, via the property innerHTML they can access the HTML content of an element.
   - You can create text nodes using the createTextNode() method, element nodes using createElement(), and attribute nodes using createAttribute().
   - After creating an element, you must first add it to the DOM tree, using different methods: insertBefore(), appendChild(), replaceChild().
   - Using the Fetch API, they can load data asynchronously from servers.
   - Beyond that, there is a veritable wealth of web APIs to explore. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ## 7 - Accessibility (ally) - Optimize websites for accessibility

    - defining alternative subtitles for videos


   ### Basic knowledge
   - Web accessibility means that the content of websites is accessible and understandable for all users, especially for people with disabilities.
   - The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) define guidelines that a web page must meet to be accessible.
   - Where possible, you should use semantic HTML elements, for example for the definition of header, footer and navigation, etc.
   - Where it is not possible or there is no standard HTML element for a particular UI component, you should define the semantics using ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ## 9 - Single Page Applications (SPA)
  * #### Part_1 - Structure of the application
    - create react app https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started  /  https://reactjs.org
  * #### Part_2 - Local state of a component
    - local state in the list component
  * #### Part_3 - The life cycle of a component
    - server communication in the list component (src/List.js)
  * #### Part_4 - styling of components
    - inline styling in react components
  * #### Part_5 - CSS classes and external stylessheets
    - integration of the stylessheets (src/List.js)

    - routine definitions in the app component (src/App.js)


   ### Basic knowledge
   - React is a library with a focus on user interface implementations and is complemented by a very rich ecosystem of third-party packages.
   - You can either initilize a React app yourself, or use the Create React app project to do so.
   - A React application consists of a tree of components.
   - React uses JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript, to build components. It distinguishes between elements, which are translated directly into HTML elements, and components, which you use to model the structure of your application.
   - There are two types of components: the older class components, which have lost much of their importance in the meantime, and the function components, which have established themselves as a quasi-standard.
   - A component can administer its own state. A change to this state causes the component to be redrawn. The state is managed with the help of the useState function.
   - The lifecycle with the mount, update and unmount phases is mapped using the useEffect function.
   - Child components receive information through attributes called props. A prop can be a string as well as an object or a function.
   - Using functions as props, child components can communicate with their parent components.
   - React provides predefined props, such as onclick, for event handling, where they can register their callback functions.
   - The context API allows you to break out of the classic data flow from parent to child components and make values available to all child nodes.
   - React Router gives you a way to navigate within a React application without completely reloading the page.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ## 9 - Understanding and using web architectures

   ### Basics
   - The architecture of software is about how to break down or divide the software into smaller components and how to organize the interaction of these components.
   - A client-server architecture divides an application into two parts: the client and the server are connected via a network. Because this architecture consists of two layers, it is also called a two-tier architecture.
   - In an N-tier architecture, the server layer is divided into further layers: a data tier and the logic tier, which contains the application logic or business logic.
   - In monolithic architecture, an application consists of a single unit that contains all the code.
   - In service-oriented architecture (SOA), the application is divided into smaller reusable services.
   - In microservice architecture, the application is divided into even smaller services.
   - In component-based architecture, the front end of an application is divided into individual reusable UI components.
   - Mircofrontends architecture divides the frontend of an application into individual features.
   - The messaging architecture ensures that individual components of an application do not communicate with each other directly, but via a message broker or message bus.
   - In the web service architecture, services are made available via the web. Web protocols are used for communication and web formats for data exchange.
   - MV* architectures are used in the front end of an application and divide the responsibility into model, view and a component responsible for communication: Controller(MVC), Presenter(MVP), and View Model(MVVM).

 ## 10 - Programming languages on the server side

   ### Basics
   - 


 ![Preview](Images/FrontendDev.png)


 ![Preview](Images/BackendDev.png)


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ## 11 - Use Javascript on the server side - Node.js
  ### before you start please install Node.js, you can do that at https://nodejs.org/en/download
   - for macOS download the pkd file
   - for windows download the msi file
   - for linux a binary package is available start there in the directory bin/node file
  ### you can check if the installation was successful
   - macOS - with $ "node -v" the installed version is displayed, with $ "node -v" the installed version is  displayed, and check if npm and npx are also installed with $ "npm -v" and $ "npx -v"
   - window - with $ "node -v" the installed version is displayed, with $ "node -v" the installed version is  displayed, and check if npm and npx are also installed with $ "npm -v" and $ "npx -v"
   - linux - $ "bin/node -v", $ "bin/npm -v", $ "bin/npx -v"


  * #### Part_1 - A simple node.js application
   - open the terminal and start the main.js with $ "node main.js" (pay attention to where the file is stored)
   - "Server is running on http://localhost:8000" open this in your browser
  * #### Part_2 - Use built-in modules
    - read files, write files, delete files (synchronous, asynchronous)
  * #### Part_3 - Deploy static files
    - customized webserver now deploys the HTML file and CSS file
     - open the terminal and start the start.js with $ "node start.js" (pay attention to where the file is stored)
   - "Server is running on http://localhost:8000" open this in your browser
  * #### Part_4 - Use web framework "express" (http://expressjs.com)
   - ##### first please install express, open the project and open the terminal and enter "npm install express" then express will be installed locally for this project
   - a webserver with the web framework express
   - customized webserver now deploys the HTML file and CSS file
   - open the terminal and start the start.js with $ "node start.js" (pay attention to where the file is stored)
   - "Server is running on http://localhost:8000" open this in your browser
  * #### Part_5 - Use web framework "express" (http://expressjs.com)customized webserver processes the data
   - customized webserver processes the data
   - customized webserver now deploys the HTML file and CSS file
   - open the terminal and start the start.js with $ "node start.js" (pay attention to where the file is stored)
   - "Server is running on http://localhost:8000" open this in your browser


 ![Preview](Images/nodeJSexpress.PNG)

 ##### if the installation of express was successful the folder node_module should have been created


   ### Basic knowledge
   - Node.js is a runtime environment for JavaScript, thanks to which JavaScript can be executed outside of browsers.
   - In addition to the runtime environment, Node.js provides various modules, with the help of which they can, for example, access the file system, implement web servers and much more.
   - About the Node.js Package Manager (npm) can also install many other packages.
   - npm also helps with the initialization of own packages.
   - The meta information of a package like name, version number and dependencies are managed in the configuration file named package.json.
   - Node.js provides many methods in a synchronous variant and an ansynchronous variant. As a rule, it is recommended to use the ansynchronous variant.
   - The web framework express is one of the most popular web frameworks and facilitates the implementation of web servers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ## 12 - Implementing web services 
  * #### Part_1 - SOAP  (Simple Object Access Protocol)
   - example for a: WSDL file(WSDL 2.0), SOAP request, SOAP response
  * #### Part_2 - REST (Representational State Transfer)
   - example for the resource https://www.alberteinstein.com/api/books/4
  * #### Part_3
   - example for the resource https://www.alberteinstein.com/api/authors/1
  * #### Part_4
   - implement a REST-API (npm install express  -->  node start.js)

  ##### Tip -> Postman https://postman.com/ (has a graphical interface instead of a command line)


   ### Basic knowledge
   - Web services make functionality of a server-side component available via the Web using an API.
   - Web services use web standards such as HTTP, XML and JSON.
   - In principle, web services can be implemented in different ways or using different technologies and concepts. Three of the best known are the SOAP protocol, the REST architectural style, and the GraphQL query language.
   - SOAP-based webservics use XML as their data exchange format and tend to be classified as heavyweight compared to the other two technologies.
   - The API of SOAP-based web services can be formally described by the Web Services Description Language (WSDL).
   - REST-based web services are strongly oriented towards the possibilities already provided by HTTP.
   - The actions that can be triggered in REST-based web services are predefined by the HTTP methods. The following HTTP methods have a special semantic meaning, which is comparable to CRUD operations from databases: POST requests (Create), GET requests (Read), PUT requests (Update), DELETE requests (Delete).
   - REST-based web services use various formats as data exchange formats, most notably JSON and XML.
   - REST based web services are expected to make up, the majority of web service implementations.
   - If it is expected that the structure of the data provided by a web service will have to be adapted frequently to the client-side requirements, GraphQL-based web services are the right choice. With them, the client can define exactly the structure of the data as it needs it via a GraphQL query. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ## 13 - Store data in databases
  * #### Part_1 - using relational databases in Node.js
   - for this example I use SQLite under Node.js with sqlite3 (https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3)
   - can be installed with the help of Node.js Package Manager using the command "npm install sqlite3".
   - for starting the webservice again "node start.js".


 ##### A good introduction to the commands supported by SQLite can be found, for example, on the SQLite homepage at https://sqlite.org/lang.html.


   ### Basic knowledge
   - Basically, a distinction is made between relational databases and non-relational databases.
   - Relational databases are called SQL (Structured Query Language) because of the query language used, while non-relational databases are called NoSQL databases, even if the latter is not quite correct, strictly speaking, because non-relational databases also use query languages that are very similar to SQL, at least in terms of syntax.
   - In relational databases, data is stored in relations. 
   - They have the possibility to communicate with databases via the SQL query language.
   - In non-relational databases, the data is not stored in relations, but in a different way or in other data structures.
   - Non-relational classes can be further classified:
        - Key-value databases use associative arrays as data structure and store the data in the form of key-value pairs ( https://redis.io and https://memcached.org/ ).
	      - Document-oriented databases are a special form of key-value databases and use so-called documents as values for storing data ( https://www.mongodb.com/ and https://couchdb.apache.org/ ).
	      - Graph databases store data in the form of graphs, where the nodes of the graph represent individual records and the edges represent the relationships between those records ( https://neo4j.com/ and https://www.arangodb.com/ )
	      - Column-oriented databases store the data in columns, where the individual columns are not part of a table, but are managed separately ( https://cassandra.apache.org/ and https://hbase.apache.org )

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ## 14 - Testing web applications (Testing)
  * #### Part_1 - Run automated test in JavaScript
   - Unit testing in JavaScript
   - for this example I use the test framework Jest ( https://jest.io/ ) to write unit tests for JavaScript
   - to run jest just enter command "npx"(node.js) then "npx jest:" ( https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect )

   ### Basic
   - Automated tests help you produce more robust code that has a clean interface, is easier to test, and that you can safely optimize.
   - There are several types of tests, of which the following are particularly relevant for web development:
	    - Over component testsas they test individual components on code level for example classes or functions.
	    - Over integration tests them the interaction of different components an application.
	    - Over End-To-End-Tests they test an application from an end (Frontend) to the other end (Backend).
	    - With performance tests, you test how an application behaves under high load (load tests) or extreme load (stress tests).
   - In test-driven development, before implementing a new component, you first formulate in a test via assertion which requirements the new component must implement.
   - An iteration consists with the test-driven development of the following five steps: Writing the test, executing the test, implementing the functionality, renewed execution of the tests, optimization/refactoring of the implementation.
   - A single test consists of four phases:
	    - In the Setup phase, initialization can be performed.
	    - In the Exercise phase, the component under test is called or executed.
	    - In the Verify phase, the actual results are compared with the expected results.
	    - In the Teardown phase, cleanup tasks can be performed.
   - With the help of special tools they can determine the test coverage, i.e. which part of the code is executed by the tests and which is not.
   - With the help of test doubles they can replace or simulate external components on which a component under test depends, so-called DOCs (Dependent-On Components), during the test. There are different types of test doubles:
	    - Test spies can be used to intercept indirect outputs of the component under test.
	    - Test stubs can be used to simulate the indirect inputs of the component under test.
	    - Mock objects can be used to check the indirect outputs of the component under test.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ## 15 - Deploying and hosting web applications
  * #### Part_1 - Package a web application with Docker
   - Install Docker ( https://docs.docker.com )
   - all available commands can be found at https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder
   - Docker images for all major Node.js versions: https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node , https://hub.docker.com/_/node

   
   ### Basic
   - For a web application to be accessible to users over the Internet, it must be hosted on a (hosting) server. You need web space on the one hand and a domain on the other.
   - Basically, there are different types of hosting:
	    - Shared hosting: here your web application shares the corresponding server with other web applications.
	    - VPS Hosting: Here your web application is operated within a virtual private server.
	    - Dedicated Hosting: where your web application is the only one running on the respective server.
	    - Cloud Hosting: Here your web application runs on a cloud infrastructure based on a network of multiple servers.
   - The step of copying an application to a server is called deployment.
   - Using Docker, web applications, or applications in general, can be pegged so that they can be installed and run within the Docker runtime environment very easily.
   - Docker Compose can be used to configure and launch setups of multiple Docker images ( https://docs.docker.com/compose/ and https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose ).
   - Types deployment: FPS, SCP, Container Management
      - FileZilla (https://filezilla.project.org), Cyberduck (https://cyberduck), ForkLift (https.//binarynights.com)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
