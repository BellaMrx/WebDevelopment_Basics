   ###  Basic knowledge - HTML
   - HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is a markup language that allows defining the structure and semantics of web pages using elements.
   - HTML elements have an opening and a closing tag
   - Attributes can be used to pass additional information to an opening tag.
   - Attributes consist of a name and an associated value.
   - There are HTML elements that can contain other elements (child elements) and text, as well as empty elements that must not contain text or other elements.
   - Web pages or HTML documents are simply text documents.
   - There are many different HTML elements. Among the most important are headings, text paragraphs, lists, links, images, tables, and forms.

   ###  Basic knowledge - CSS
   - CSS rules let you define how the content of certain HTML elements should be displayed.
   - CSS rules consist of two parts: The selector defines which HTML elements the CSS rule should be applied to. The declaration defines how exactly these HTML elements are to be displayed.
   - Individual declarations in turn consist of a property and a value. 
   - There are several ways to include CSS in an HTML document: External Stylesheet, Internal Stylesheet, Inline Styles.
   - CSS can be used to design all components of a web page. For texts, for example, the font, font style, text color and alignment can be adjusted. It can also be used to design tables, lists, forms and much more. 
   - In CSS there are several layout systems for arranging elements: Float layout, Flexbox layout, Grid layout.

   ###  Basic knowledge - JavaScript
   - JavaScript can be included in a web page in several ways. However, you should get into the habit of managing JavaScript code in separate files.
   - Variables can be defined in JavaScript using the let keyword, while constants can be defined using the const keyword.
   - There are different data types in JavaScript: on the one hand, the standard primitive data types for numbers, strings, and Boolean values, as well as the special data types undefined and null, and on the other hand, objects.
   - In JavaScript there are different types of operations available: arithmetic operators, operators for working with strings, logical operations for working with boolean values, bitwise operators for working with bits, operators for comparing values, special operators for type checking, among others.
   - You can control the control flow of a JavaScript_program using conditional statements, branching, multiple branching, counting loops, and header-controlled and footer-controlled loops.
   - You can define reusable program parts via functions. Functions can be called with arguments and return a return value.
   - In JavaScript there are different types of errors: syntx errors, runtime errors, logical errors. 
   - When an error occurs during the execution of a program, you can react to such errors: Using the keyword try you mark the statements that could potentially throw errors, using the keyword catch you define the statements that should be executed in case of an error.
   - With JavaScript you have the possibility to generate HTML code dynamically.


 ## 4 - Weblogs


 ![Preview](Images/Statuscodes.png)


   ###  Basic knowledge - Weblogs
   - HTTP, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol is a unidirectional client/server protocol where the HTTP client makes HTTP requests to the HTTP server and the server responds with an HTTP response.
   - Using headers, it can pass additional meta-information to HTTP requests and HTTP responses.
   - HTTP methods define what actions should be performed on the HTTP server.
   - The status code of an HTTP response defines whether an HTTP request was successfully processed or not. 
   - MIME types define the format of the data that is transferred via an HTTP request or an HTTP response.
   - Polling and long polling are techniques by which a cleint polls data from the server at regular intervals. The communication is unidirectional from the client to the server.
   - Server-sent events allow data to be actively sent from the server to the client. The communication is unidirectional from the server to the client.
   - The WebSocket client can send data to the WebSocket server, but also the server can actively send data to the client - provided that the client has previously established a Web socket connection to the server.

 ![Preview](Images/ImageFormats.PNG)

 ![Preview](Images/AudioVideoAttributes.png)


   ### Basic knowledge - Webformats
   - CSV format is a very simple data format, suitable for defining records line by line and separated by commas.
   - For the structuring of complex data, for example nested data, the XML and JSON data formats are suitable.
   - XML and JSON are the two most important data exchange formats on the web.
   - JSON has become somewhat more popular over XML in recent years because it is much leaner and much easier to process in JavaScript.
   - For saving images and graphics you can use different formats: JPG, GIF, PNG, SVG, WebP.
   - For embedding video and audio files, since HTML5 you can use the video and audio elements.
   - There are many different video and audio formats, but thanks to the HTML elements you can include several formats for one video or for one audio file.


 ## 6 - Web APIs
  * #### Part_1 - Select elements
    - selection of all elements with the CSS class "even" and subsequent iteration over the elements

  ### JavaScript - HTML DOM Methods
   #### the different methods and properties for selecting elements


 ![Preview](Images/DOM_1.PNG)


   #### the different methods and properties for modifying elements


 ![Preview](Images/DOM_2.PNG)


   ### Basic knowledge - Web APIs
   - The DOM API allows programmatic access to the Document Object Model(DOM), a hierarchical tree structure that represents the object model for a web page.
   - The individual components in this tree structure are called nodes, and there are several types of nodes. The most important are document nodes, element nodes, text nodes, and attribute nodes.
   - The DOM API defines properties and methods that you can use to access or modify the DOM tree of a web page.
   - For example, you can use the DOM API to add elements, delete elements, modify text, and add or delete attributes .
   - Elements on a web page can be selected in various ways by: ID, CSS class, element name, name attribute, CSS selector.
   - Starting from an element/node, the parent element/node, child elements/child nodes and sibling elements/sibling nodes can be selected via various properties.
   - Via the property textContent they can access the text content of a node, via the property innerHTML they can access the HTML content of an element.
   - You can create text nodes using the createTextNode() method, element nodes using createElement(), and attribute nodes using createAttribute().
   - After creating an element, you must first add it to the DOM tree, using different methods: insertBefore(), appendChild(), replaceChild().
   - Using the Fetch API, they can load data asynchronously from servers.
   - Beyond that, there is a veritable wealth of web APIs to explore.

   ### Basic knowledge - Ally
   - Web accessibility means that the content of websites is accessible and understandable for all users, especially for people with disabilities.
   - The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) define guidelines that a web page must meet to be accessible.
   - Where possible, you should use semantic HTML elements, for example for the definition of header, footer and navigation, etc.
   - Where it is not possible or there is no standard HTML element for a particular UI component, you should define the semantics using ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications).

   ### Basic knowledge - SPA
   - React is a library with a focus on user interface implementations and is complemented by a very rich ecosystem of third-party packages.
   - You can either initilize a React app yourself, or use the Create React app project to do so.
   - A React application consists of a tree of components.
   - React uses JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript, to build components. It distinguishes between elements, which are translated directly into HTML elements, and components, which you use to model the structure of your application.
   - There are two types of components: the older class components, which have lost much of their importance in the meantime, and the function components, which have established themselves as a quasi-standard.
   - A component can administer its own state. A change to this state causes the component to be redrawn. The state is managed with the help of the useState function.
   - The lifecycle with the mount, update and unmount phases is mapped using the useEffect function.
   - Child components receive information through attributes called props. A prop can be a string as well as an object or a function.
   - Using functions as props, child components can communicate with their parent components.
   - React provides predefined props, such as onclick, for event handling, where they can register their callback functions.
   - The context API allows you to break out of the classic data flow from parent to child components and make values available to all child nodes.
   - React Router gives you a way to navigate within a React application without completely reloading the page.  


 ## 9 - Use Javascript on the server side - Node.js
  ### before you start please install Node.js, you can do that at https://nodejs.org/en/download
   - for macOS download the pkd file
   - for windows download the msi file
   - for linux a binary package is available start there in the directory bin/node file
  ### you can check if the installation was successful
   - macOS - with $ "node -v" the installed version is displayed, with $ "node -v" the installed version is  displayed, and check if npm and npx are also installed with $ "npm -v" and $ "npx -v"
   - window - with $ "node -v" the installed version is displayed, with $ "node -v" the installed version is  displayed, and check if npm and npx are also installed with $ "npm -v" and $ "npx -v"
   - linux - $ "bin/node -v", $ "bin/npm -v", $ "bin/npx -v"
  * #### Part_1 - A simple node.js application
   - open the terminal and start the main.js with $ "node main.js" (pay attention to where the file is stored)

* #### Part_5 - Use web framework "express" (http://expressjs.com)customized webserver processes the data
   - customized webserver processes the data
   - customized webserver now deploys the HTML file and CSS file
   - open the terminal and start the start.js with $ "node start.js" (pay attention to where the file is stored)
   - "Server is running on http://localhost:8000" open this in your browser


 ![Preview](Images/nodeJSexpress.PNG)

 ##### if the installation of express was successful the folder node_module should have been created


   ### Basic knowledge - Javascript on the server side
   - Node.js is a runtime environment for JavaScript, thanks to which JavaScript can be executed outside of browsers.
   - In addition to the runtime environment, Node.js provides various modules, with the help of which they can, for example, access the file system, implement web servers and much more.
   - About the Node.js Package Manager (npm) can also install many other packages.
   - npm also helps with the initialization of own packages.
   - The meta information of a package like name, version number and dependencies are managed in the configuration file named package.json.
   - Node.js provides many methods in a synchronous variant and an ansynchronous variant. As a rule, it is recommended to use the ansynchronous variant.
   - The web framework express is one of the most popular web frameworks and facilitates the implementation of web servers.


 ## 10 - Implementing web services 
  * #### Part_1 - SOAP  (Simple Object Access Protocol)
   - example for a: WSDL file(WSDL 2.0), SOAP request, SOAP response

  * #### Part_3
   - example for the resource https://www.alberteinstein.com/api/authors/1
  * #### Part_4
   - implement a REST-API (npm install express  -->  node start.js)

  ##### Tip -> Postman https://postman.com/ (has a graphical interface instead of a command line)


   ### Basic knowledge - Implementing web services
   - Webservices stellen über eine API Funktionalität einer serverseitigen Komponente über das Web zur Verfügung.
   - Webservices verwenden dabei Webstandards wie HTTP, XML und JSON.
   - Prinzipell lassen sich Webservices auf verschiedene Art und Weise bzw. unter Verwendung verschiedener Technologien und Konzepte umsetzen. Drei der bekanntesten sind das Protokoll SOAP, der Architekturstil REST und die Anfragesprache GraphQL.
   - SOAP-basierte Webservics verwenden als Datenaustauschformat XML und sind im Vergleich zu den anderen beiden Technologien eher als schwergewichtig einzuordnen.
   - Die API SOAP-basierter Webservices kann durch die Web Services Description Language (WSDL) formal beschrieben werden.
   - REST-basierte Webservices orientieren sich stark an den Möglichkeiten, die bereits durch HTTP vorgegeben sind.
   - Die Aktionen, die bei REST-basierten Webservices angestoßen werden können, sind durch die HTTP-Methoden vordefiniert. Folgenden HTTP-Methoden kommt dabei eine besondere semantische Bedeutung zu, die vergleichbar mit der von CRUD-Operationen aus Datenbanken ist: POST-Anfragen(Create), GET-Anfragen(Read), PUT-Anfragen(Update), DELETE-Anfragen(Delete)
   - REST-basierte Webservices verwenden verschiedene Formate als Datenaustauschformat, allen voran JSON und XML.
   - REST-basierte Webservices dürften, den größten Teil der Webservice-Implentierungen ausmachen.
   - Wenn damit zu rechnen ist, dass die Struktur der Daten, die ein Webservice bereitstellt, öfters an die clientseitigen Anforderungen angepasst werden muss, sind GraphQL-basierte Webservices die richtige Wahl. Bei ihnen kann der Client über eine GraphQL-Querry genau die Struktur der Daten definieren, so wie er sie benötigt.
